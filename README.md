Here is the READ.me specifications required for the final project:

Overview: 
  We are handing in the website for the final project, which can be viewed from the index.html file on the top layer of the web structure. The title of our website is called "Meat" Your Worst Nightmare, in reference to the harm meat has, particularly on the environment. The main goals our website accomplishes the following: 
    1) To raise the userâ€™s awareness of the environmental impact from the meat industry.
    2) Expose the user to the hard fact that meat production produce much more GHG emissions to our planet.
    3) Engage the users to evaluate their daily diet and its relationship to the environment in a playful way.

  There are four main visualizations on the website, each mainly worked on by individual group members:
  
    1) Interactive Global Meat Consumption Choropleth Map - showing which countries consume meat more than others; the user can turn the choropleth map to see more countries.
    
    2) Interactive Treemap Chart - here, the user can see a direct comparison between the energy efficiency of producing different kinds of meats, vegetables, grains, and fruits, with additional interactivity to compare foods that are within the aforementioned food groups. 
    
    3) Interactive Emission Chart - The most innovative visualization, we allow the user to "create a meal" that he or she had eaten today and see how many kg of CO2 is released into the earth for each meal. This is displayed on a cool plate setup.
    
    4) Interactive Flow Chart - We can see what goes into making meat, from the crops, etc. to the overall waste. The user can see an immense amount of waste in the picture.
